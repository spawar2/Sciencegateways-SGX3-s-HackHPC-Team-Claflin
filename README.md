Project Description: Adapting High-Performance Computing (HPC) tools in image classification using Convulutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Blog Post: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized neural network for processing data that has an input shape like a 2D matrix like images. CNN's are typically used for image detection and classification. In this example we learn how to implement CNN on general images, which then can be replicated for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) on radioimaging datasets like X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, etc.
